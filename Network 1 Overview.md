## Full Stack Scope

These projects demonstrate ***end-to-end system ownership*** across game, backend, infrastructure, and operations.

### Game Layer / Frontend (Minecraft In-Game)
- Developed/Maintained 10 custom ***Bukkit/Paper/Spigot plugins*** across the project lifetime  
- Designed ***player-facing UI***: scoreboards, inventories, menus, command flows  
- ***Reverse-engineered legacy plugins*** (SG, UHC Games, UHC Meetup) for expansion and maintainability

### Application Layer / Backend
- Managed ***game state***, ***player profiles***, and ***multi-node orchestration*** across BungeeCord networks  
- Implemented ***MySQL*** and ***Redis*** systems, including pipelines & replication  
- Built ***custom APIs*** for cross-server features and external service integration

### Infrastructure / DevOps / Security
- Maintained production ***Linux servers***; configured ***iptables***, uptime monitoring, and DDoS protections  
- Wrote deployment pipelines and ***custom CI/DI scripts*** for live updates & rollbacks  
- Maintained ***web services, Teamspeak 3, Xenforo, Apache, and custom web panels***

### Operations / Network Management
- Led ***live production***: revamps, rebrands, updates  
- Managed ***network-wide configs*** across plugins and backend services  
- Coordinated ***staff*** and ensured ***operational stability*** (~100 avg, ~300 peak)

This stack shows the ability to own and maintain multiple projects from conception → deployment → maintenance — culminating in ***Owner Developer (CTO-level)*** responsibility.
