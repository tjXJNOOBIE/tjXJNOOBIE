# TJ — Server Engineer / Plugin Developer / DevOps
### Full-Stack Minecraft Systems • Java Backend • DevOps • Reverse Engineering • 8 YOE

I'm a Java Server Engineer with 8 years of experience building general backend systems, game backends, and full Minecraft networks. 
I work on everything from internal frameworks, APIs, and custom game modes to full networks and backends, either solo or within a team.

---
## What I Do
- **Java Backend / Minecraft Architecture Design**  
  Create and design new games and systems from concept -> code -> release, with player experience as a first-class concern.

- **Full-Stack Minecraft Development**  
  Game logic, matchmaking, profiles, economy, GUIs, stats, databases, the works.

- **Minecraft Network Operations & Ownership**  
  Operated/Owned multiple networks; Max. ~120 avg / ~300 peak concurrent players.

- **Development Leadership**  
  End-to-end ownership, mentoring, interviews, onboarding, live production overhauls, rebrands.

- **Reverse Engineering & Modernization**  
  Rebuild undocumented, legacy software into maintainable, extensible, feature-rich systems.

- **General Java Backend Development**  
  SQL, Redis, caching, APIs.

- **DevOps & Infrastructure**  
  Bare-metal Linux servers, firewalls, third-party services, distributed server orchestration.

## Projects 

**I'm only including Minecraft projects I played a significant role in, owned code, and served a public userbase. More projects available upon request.**

> Minecraft Projects - All incorporate backend and API building. All games run as single-instance servers with deterministic state and serverd a public userbase.

- **SG & UHC Free For All** – FFA game mode with map rotation, kits, and a custom ELO system.  
- **Survival Games** – Competitive Survival Games implementation inspired by MCGamers/MCSG. Reverse-engineered project.  
- **UHC Games** – Survival Games-style UHC with additional systems such as player wagering and legacy tracking.  
- **UHC Meetup** – Fast-paced UHC mini-game inspired by Badlion/Hypixel Meetup.  
- **UHC** – Scenario-based UHC with custom game flow and zombie logout handling.  
- **ELO System** – Letter-grade-based player rating system used across competitive game modes.

> Backend & Framework Projects
- **Game Server Lobby** – Hub/Lobby system for server orchestration.  
- **Game Server Core** – Backend core system and API for game servers.  
- **Project-Novus (Private)**  
  **Project Novus is a modular Java backend and framework designed to support complex, stateful game systems in production environments.**
  - Interface-driven dependency injection container with annotation scanning.
  - Type-safe DependencyMap using interface keys and metadata-backed values.
  - Metadata-based behavior delegation via generic type parameters.
  - Retention manager with custom Retention Rating (RR) based on player behavior and purchases.
  - Glicko-2 rating system capable of handling unlimited players in free-for-all environments.
  - AbstractCache: type-safe cache designed for concurrency and system distribution.
  - AbstractRegistry: type-safe registry system with metadata-driven lifecycle control.
  - CustomRunnable: task system supporting delayed, repeating, synchronous, and asynchronous execution.
  - Custom logging framework with structured output and asynchronous handling.
  - Custom event system with EventBus and tagged events (e.g., MySQLDisconnectEvent).
  - [See feature list with images of Project Novus. ](https://github.com/tjXJNOOBIE/PROJECT-NOVUS-PUBLIC) Code is currently private but can be shared with trusted parties.
 
> General & Minecraft Development Operations
- Managed multi-region game server orchestration with database replication.
- Migrated clients from shared hosting environments to dedicated bare-metal Linux servers.
- Scaled player capacity ~2× through network upgrades and performance optimization.
- Responsible for security across game servers, proxies, web services, TeamSpeak, and third-party integrations.
- Managed and integrated most third-party services alongside development operations.

## My Journey

*_Born 2000 – Gaming & Systems from 2002_*

I’ve been building, playing, and experimenting with **_technology_** since age 2, hosting a **_cracked Minecraft server_**, creating content on **_YouTube_** and **_Twitch_** by 10, and developing through my preteens/teens. For the story, projects, and technical timeline, see: [**Personal Journey**](https://github.com/tjXJNOOBIE/Portfolio/blob/main/PERSONAL_AT_A_GLANCE.md)
